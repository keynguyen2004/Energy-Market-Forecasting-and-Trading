# UK-energy-trading
### Project aim
Construct a forecasting model to predict auction price and implement trading strategy accordingly

### Dataset Documentation
The dataset that we will be using for this particular problem can be found on Kaggle at this

### Outline
This project essentially boils down to a time-series forecasting problem, where the aim is to predict auction price in UK energy market and maximize predicitve accuracy. The accuracy is measured by the deviations of the predicted values from the true values (i.e., minimizing standard error)

data preprocessing: (slide + interpolation image)

forecasting model: (slide + model performance image)

trading strategy: (rule, constraints)

result + image of tradeoff
